# **Frequently asked questions (FAQ)**

### **Q: Is PocketLink secure? Can it read my browsing data?**

**A:** Yes, the extension is secure. It is designed with privacy in mind and requests the absolute minimum permissions required to function. It **cannot** read your browsing history, see the content of pages, or access your passwords. The activeTab and scripting permissions only allow it to run a tiny piece of code to copy text to your clipboard; it cannot read any information from the page.

### **Q: Why do I need a Bit.ly account and access token?**

**A:** For its initial version, PocketLink uses the Bit.ly API to power its link shortening. Using your personal token means that all links created are associated with your account. This allows you to track link analytics, use your own custom domains (if you have them), and manage your links directly from your Bit.ly dashboard.

### **Q: I'm getting an error that says "The access token is invalid." What should I do?**

**A:** This error means the token you saved in the options is incorrect or has been revoked. Please follow these steps:

1. Generate a new Generic Access Token from your \[suspicious link removed\].  
2. Click the PocketLink icon in your browser toolbar to open the options page.  
3. Paste the new token into the input field and click "Save Token".  
4. Try creating a link again.

### **Q: Will this extension work in browsers other than Google Chrome?**

**A:** Yes. This extension is built on the standard Chromium extension platform. It should work perfectly in any modern browser based on Chromium, including **Microsoft Edge**, **Brave Browser**, **Vivaldi**, and **Opera**.

### **Q: I found a bug or have a feature request. What can I do?**

**A:** (Placeholder) Currently, this is a personal project. In the future, a public repository (like on GitHub) may be created to formally track issues and feature requests.
