# **Contributing to PocketLink**

First off, thank you for considering contributing\! Every contribution, from a bug report to a new feature, helps make PocketLink better for everyone.

This document provides a set of guidelines to help you contribute to the project in a way that is effective and consistent.

## **Code of Conduct**

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [PocketLink Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jamditis/pocketlink/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## **How can I contribute?**

### **Reporting bugs**

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jsamditis/pocketlink/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jsamditis/pocketlink/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Use the "Bug Report" template.

### **Suggesting enhancements**

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue using the "Feature Request" template. This allows for a discussion of the idea before any development work begins.

### **Submitting a pull request**

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from main.  
2. Make your changes. Please adhere to the existing code style.  
3. Ensure your code is well-commented, especially in areas that might be hard to understand.  
4. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.  
5. Open a new pull request, using the Pull Request Template to provide a clear description of the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.  
6. The project owner will review your pull request and may suggest changes.

## **Styleguides**

* Use two spaces for indentation.  
* Comment your code liberally. Explain the "why," not just the "what."  
* Keep variable and function names clear and descriptive.

Thank you for your contribution\!
