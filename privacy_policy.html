    <h1>Privacy policy for PocketLink</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy explains how PocketLink ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension. Your privacy and trust are very important to us.</p>

    <h2>What information we collect</h2>
    <p>PocketLink is designed to be as private as possible. The only piece of data we store is your Bit.ly Generic Access Token.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bit.ly access token:</strong> This token is required to create shortlinks on your behalf. You provide this token voluntarily on the extension's options page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any other personal information, browsing history, or page content.</p>

    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your **Bit.ly access token** is used exclusively to make authenticated API calls to the Bit.ly service (`https://api-ssl.bitly.com/`) for the sole purpose of shortening URLs as you request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we store your information</h2>
    <p>Your Bit.ly access token is stored locally on your computer using the sandboxed <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> API provided by your browser. This method has two key benefits:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> The data is stored securely by your browser and is not accessible by other websites or extensions.</li>
        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> If you are signed into your browser's account (e.g., your Google Account), this token will sync securely across your devices, so you only need to set it up once.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We never see or have access to this token. It is stored and used entirely within your own browser.</p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The PocketLink extension communicates with one third-party service: the Bit.ly API. This is necessary for the core functionality of the extension. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Bit.ly. You can review Bit.ly's privacy policy <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us.</p>
