### **1\. Introduction and vision**

In an environment where information is shared rapidly, the speed and efficiency of sharing links are paramount. **PocketLink** is a browser extension designed to provide the fastest possible workflow for creating and copying a shortlink. Its vision is to eliminate the need to navigate to external websites or use other tools, integrating the link shortening process seamlessly into the user's natural browsing behavior.

### **2\. Target audience**

This extension is designed for users who frequently share links and value efficiency, including:

* **Social media managers & digital marketers:** Professionals who need to quickly generate tracked shortlinks for campaigns across various platforms.  
* **Content creators & bloggers:** Individuals who share their work or other interesting links with their audience and want to maintain a clean aesthetic.  
* **General power users:** Anyone who regularly shares links with friends, family, or colleagues and prefers the conciseness of a shortlink.

### **3\. User stories and scenarios**

* **As a social media manager,** I want to right-click on a news article and instantly get a shortlink, so I can paste it directly into our company's social media scheduler without breaking my workflow.  
* **As a content creator,** I want the shortlink to be copied to my clipboard automatically, so I can save the step of manually selecting and copying the link.  
* **As a new user,** I want a simple, one-time setup process to securely save my API token, so I don't have to enter it repeatedly.  
* **As any user,** I want to receive clear, immediate feedback confirming that the link was created and copied, or a clear message if something went wrong.
